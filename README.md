# To-Do List Website

This is a simple Jekyll-themed website I made to keep track of notes/reminders. I learned Ruby and Markdown for the first time while making this website, and it took a while to get used to the new languages.

Built with ❤️ using Tonic (tonic.hackclub.com) - a Hack Club event for learning Jekyll!
